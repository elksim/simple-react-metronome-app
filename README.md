# simple-react-metronome-app

just a simple app to familiarize myself with react-native. Useable, but very limited functionality at the moment.

run npm init to build path.js and populate assets/clicks/ then npm start

## TODO

- buttons to increase/decrease bpm
- add a settings page where new click sounds can be selected
  - also, a way to create your own click sound.
- clean up and style the main page
- add a simple visualiser
- build and deploy to play store
- maybes:
  - on android the first click played is a flam/doubled...
  - determine another way to handle changing click bpms
  - fix bugs and poor layout on web view
  - consider yarn
  - consider typescript / jsdoc
